The mammalian UPR activates three signal transducers, ATF6, Ire1, and PERK. 1) Activation of ATF6 leads to increased expression of genes regulated by ERSEs in their promoters including ER chaperones like BiP and GRP94, as well as the transcription factor XBP-1. Activation of Ire1 leads to alternative XBP-1 splicing, which in turn up-regulates XBP-1 specific targets like ERdj4, as well as targets with ERSEs in their promoter. A PERK-dependent target other than ATF4 can influence the activation of the ERSE site by an unknown mechanism, which is indicated by a question mark in the schematics. 2) PERK activation leads to eIF-2{alpha} phosphorylation, which allows the expression of the ATF4 transcription factor that in turn induces GADD34 transcription. There is no evidence at this time for members of the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1 pathways to impact on the PERK pathway. 3) Finally, the ATF6, Ire1/XBP-1 and PERK pathways converge to optimally induce targets that include CHOP and Herp. Those targets that are downstream of the PERK branch of the UPR are shared with various other cellular stress conditions like heme deficiency, amino acid deprivation, and dsRNA expression. These stresses all activate an eIF-2{alpha} kinase and as a result induce downstream targets like ATF4 and GADD34, as well as those that are dually regulated by both the shared and the ER stress-specific branches of the UPR, which are represented by CHOP and Herp.

PERK phosphorylates and inactivates eIF2alpha, thereby globally shutting off mRNA translation and reducing the protein load on the ER.  However, certain mRNAs gain a selective advantage for translation under these conditions, including the mRNA encoding transcription factor ATF4. The ATF4 protein is a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors, which regulates the promoters of several genes implicated in the UPR."

Phosphorylation of eIF2{alpha} inhibits general protein synthesis by reducing the levels of eIF2-GTP that are required for binding of initiator tRNA to the translation apparatus. Concomitant with lowered protein synthesis, eIF2{alpha} phosphorylation leads to preferential translation of ATF4, a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription activator important for directing transcription of stress-related genes (17?20). Reduced protein synthesis conserves energy and provides the cell time for ATF4 and other stress-responsive transcription factors to reconfigure gene expression slated to alleviate damage elicited by the underlying stress. Other members of the eIF2 kinase family include PEK/Perk (EIF2AK3), whose activity is enhanced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (21, 22); HRI (EIF2AK1), which is regulated by heme deficiency and oxidative stress (23); and PKR (EIF2AK2), which functions in an antiviral pathway (24).{P@S52 is the common phosphorylation site between all 4 kinases and confirmed in Uniprot}"

We show that the mdr1 promoter (-1165 to +84) is able to activate the expression of a reporter gene in response to 3-MC in Hepa-1c1c7 but not in BP(r)c1 cells. Deletion analysis indicated that the region from -245 to -141 contains cis-acting sequences mediating the induction, including a potential p53 binding sequence. 3-MC treatment of the cells increased the levels of p53 and induced p53 binding to the mdr1 promoter in an AhR.Arnt-dependent manner. Mutations in the p53 binding site abrogated induction of mdr1 by 3-MC, indicating that p53 binding to the mdr1 promoter is essential for the induction."

If true, such a model would strongly support the HIF system as an anticancer target.  Several studies have sought to test this model genetically in studies of experimental tumor formation by cells that are defective in particular components of the HIF pathway. The first of these used a series of mouse hepatoma cells that are functionally defective for HIF-1beta and cannot form an active HIF complex. When grown as subcutaneous tumors, the mutant cells manifest a near-total loss of the peri-necrotic enhancement of VEGF gene expression that is apparent in wild-type cells. This was associated with marked reductions in tumor angiogenesis and growth rates106. Similar reductions in growth and vascular density in tumors grown from human colon and breast carcinoma cell lines have been observed after expression of a peptide that antagonizes HIF transcription by abrogating the interaction of HIF-alpha and p300 (ref. 107)."

For a substantial number of these genes, promoter analysis has also clearly identified HREs that interact directly with HIF. The expression of other genes may be affected indirectly by secondary cascades of gene regulation. Even with respect to a single molecule, there may be many interfaces with hypoxia and hypoxia pathways (Fig. 3). This is well-illustrated for VEGF. In hypoxia, VEGF transcription is upregulated by HIF18, 19, mRNA stability is increased by binding of proteins to specific sequences in the 3' UTR71, and an internal ribosomal entry site allows preserved translation in the face of normal cellular hypoxic shutdown72. The biological activity of secreted VEGF is further influenced by hypoxia-inducible expression of the Flt-1 receptor49, post-transcriptional regulation of the Kdr receptor50 and VEGF-induced effects on soluble Flt-1 (ref. 73), which inhibits VEGF action (Fig. 3). Essential role of HIF in developmental angiogenesis In keeping with the central role of HIF in responses to hypoxia observed in tissue culture, targeted inactivation of either Hif1a (refs. 68,70,74) or Arnt (encoding HIF-1beta)75 in the mouse results in abnormal vascular development and embryonic lethality."

Reversal of Starvation-Induced Metabolic Shifts An ancient eukaryotic response to nutrient starvation and hypoxia (reviewed in Refs. 72 and 202) is orchestrated by conserved trimeric protein kinases that consist of a catalytic alpha-subunit, a substrate-defining and targeting beta-subunit (249, 317), and a regulatory gamma-subunit. These protein kinases, termed Snf1 in yeast and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in animals, have a common mechanism of regulation by reversible phosphorylation."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

In response to hypoxia, the brain initiates numerous adaptive responses at the organ level as well as at the molecular and cellular levels, including the alteration of gene expression. Astrocytes play critical roles in the proper functioning of the brain; thus the manner in which astrocytes respond to hypoxia is likely important in determining the outcome of brain hypoxia. Here, we used microarray gene expression profiling and data-analysis algorithms to identify and analyze hypoxia-responsive genes in primary human astrocytes. We also compared gene expression patterns in astrocytes with those in human HeLa cells and pulmonary artery endothelial cells (ECs). Remarkably, in astrocytes, five times as many genes were induced as suppressed, whereas in HeLa and pulmonary ECs, as many as or more genes were suppressed than induced. More genes encoding hypoxia-inducible functions, such as glycolytic enzymes and angiogenic growth factors, were strongly induced in astrocytes compared with HeLa cells. Furthermore, gene ontology and computational algorithms revealed that many target genes of the EGF and insulin signaling pathways and the transcriptional regulators Myc, Jun, and p53 were selectively altered by hypoxia in astrocytes. Indeed, Western blot analysis confirmed that two major signal transducers mediating insulin and EGF action, Akt and MEK1/2, were activated by hypoxia in astrocytes. These results provide a global view of the signaling and regulatory network mediating oxygen regulation in human astrocytes."

This confirms that the block in tumour progression was due to a failure to activate the angiogenic switch. It also provides further support for the model of an angiogenic switch that is determined by the ultimate balance in pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, and that oncogene expression can influence this balance. Angiogenesis differs among tumour types Despite the fact that angiogenesis begins at different stages in all of these examples, neovascularization is usually a prerequisite for tumour progression. There are, however, some examples of tumours that do not require neovascularization. For example, astrocytomas first acquire their blood supply by co-opting existing normal brain blood vessels without initiating angiogenesis, making them a 'non-angiogenic tumour' (FIG. 4). They instead grow along blood vessels, without a tumour capsule, eliciting an invasive character, and can enlarge as much as some angiogenic tumours56. However, when grade III astrocytomas progress to grade IV astrocytomas/glioblastomas (glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM), they become hypoxic and necrotic - partly due to vessel regression caused by ANG2 upregulation57 and increased tumour-cell proliferation. Although it seems to be a paradox that blood vessels first regress as tumours progress, the hypoxic conditions eventually induce the formation of new blood vessels. The most prominent hypoxia-induced angiogenic factors are VEGF and VEGFR2, which, in conjunction with ANG2, promote vascular remodelling and sprouting23,56."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

There were 245 gene probes that showed at least 1.5-fold increase in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5; 325 gene probes showed at least 1.5-fold decrease in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5. The largest category of genes down-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded proteins involved in cell growth/proliferation. Many genes up-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded cytokines/growth factors, receptors, and other signaling proteins. Transcription factors accounted for the largest group of HIF-1-regulated genes, indicating that HIF-1 controls a network of transcriptional responses to hypoxia in endothelial cells. Infection of endothelial cells with AdCA5 under nonhypoxic conditions was sufficient to induce increased basement membrane invasion and tube formation similar to the responses induced by hypoxia, indicating that HIF-1 mediates cell-autonomous activation of endothelial cells."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

Tumours contain elevated VEGF levels at the rim of necrotic and hypoxic tissue. This is also where new blood-vessel sprouting occurs. In addition to sensing glucose and other nutrients provided by the circulation, most cells are sensitive to hypoxia. Oxygen and nutrient requirements vary among tumours, depending on their stage and the microenvironment they are growing in. Commonly, oxygen consumption is reduced in tumour cells, in comparison to the normal cells.

The carboxyl terminus of each ENaC subunit contains a PPxY, motif which is believed to be important for interaction with the WW domains of the ubiquitin-protein ligase, Nedd4. Disruption of this interaction, as in Liddle's syndrome, where mutations delete or alter the PPxY motif of either the beta or gamma subunits, has been proposed to result in increased ENaC activity. Here we present evidence that KIAA0439 protein, a close relative of Nedd4, is also a potential regulator of ENaC. We demonstrate that KIAA0439 WW domains bind all three ENaC subunits. We show that a recombinant KIAA0439 WW domain protein acts as a dominant negative mutant that can interfere with the Na(+)-dependent feedback inhibition of ENaC in whole-cell patch clamp experiments. We propose that KIAA0439 and Nedd4 proteins either play a redundant role in ENaC regulation or function in a tissue- and/or signal-specific manner to down-regulate ENaC."

If true, such a model would strongly support the HIF system as an anticancer target.  Several studies have sought to test this model genetically in studies of experimental tumor formation by cells that are defective in particular components of the HIF pathway. The first of these used a series of mouse hepatoma cells that are functionally defective for HIF-1beta and cannot form an active HIF complex. When grown as subcutaneous tumors, the mutant cells manifest a near-total loss of the peri-necrotic enhancement of VEGF gene expression that is apparent in wild-type cells. This was associated with marked reductions in tumor angiogenesis and growth rates106. Similar reductions in growth and vascular density in tumors grown from human colon and breast carcinoma cell lines have been observed after expression of a peptide that antagonizes HIF transcription by abrogating the interaction of HIF-alpha and p300 (ref. 107)."

Consistent with a major role for hypoxia in the overall process, a large number of genes involved in different steps of angiogenesis are independently responsive to hypoxia in tissue culture. Examples include nitric oxide synthases involved in governing vascular tone, growth factors such as VEGF, angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors and their various receptors, and genes involved in matrix metabolism, including matrix metalloproteinases, plasminogen activator receptors and inhibitors, and collagen prolyl hydroxylase16, 17, 18, 19, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 (Table 1). Similarly, many of the individual phenotypic processes in angiogenesis such as cell migration or endothelial tube formation can be induced by hypoxic tissue culture62, 63, 64. These analyses in isolated systems have sometimes apparently shown both positive and negative effects of hypoxia, for instance on endothelial proliferation65, 66, 67. It is not yet clear whether such phenomena reflect fundamentally different responses based on severity of hypoxia, or counter-regulatory controls that are normally integrated in a productive way."

To determine whether HIF-1 also mediates cell-autonomous responses to hypoxia, we have compared gene expression profiles in arterial endothelial cells cultured under nonhypoxic versus hypoxic conditions and in nonhypoxic cells infected with adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase versus a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha (AdCA5). There were 245 gene probes that showed at least 1.5-fold increase in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5; 325 gene probes showed at least 1.5-fold decrease in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5. The largest category of genes down-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded proteins involved in cell growth/proliferation. Many genes up-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded cytokines/growth factors, receptors, and other signaling proteins. Transcription factors accounted for the largest group of HIF-1-regulated genes, indicating that HIF-1 controls a network of transcriptional responses to hypoxia in endothelial cells. Infection of endothelial cells with AdCA5 under nonhypoxic conditions was sufficient to induce increased basement membrane invasion and tube formation similar to the responses induced by hypoxia, indicating that HIF-1 mediates cell-autonomous activation of endothelial cells."

Because HIF-1a is involved in Met gene expression, the constitutive activation of HIF-1a as a consequence of pVHL deregulation provides a mechanism explaining the observation that the expression of HGF and Met receptor is associated with genetic alterations of VHL in primary RCC. Hypoxic cell sensitisation to HGF has therefore been proposed as an invasive switch that facilitates cell movement away from an area of low oxygen availability, and is dependent on the ability of pVHL to degrade HIFa (Figure 4). The gene encoding the chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been discovered as a novel HIF target based on a microarray comparison of genetic profiles derived from VHL-null RCC cells and their isogenic wild-type VHLexpressing counterparts [52]."

Activation of a transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), through the stimulation of the expression of the HIF-1a subunit - the molecular sensor of hypoxia (Semenza 2001, Wenger 2002, Hopfl et al. 2004) - may be the mechanism through which low oxygen tension links to inflammation (Trayhurn & Wood 2004). The target genes for HIF-1 include VEGF and leptin, and expression of both of these has been shown to be stimulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to hypoxia (Lolmede et al. 2003)."

The VHL-mediated proteolytic degradation of HIF suppresses a transcription programme that is normally engaged by HIF as part of the adaptive response of the cell to hypoxia, such as the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a potent angiogenic factor that is involved in the formation and differentiation of blood vessels. Aberrant HIF control, therefore, partially helps to explain the highly vascular phenotype of VHL-null tumours. Additionally, HIF regulates genes that are involved in glucose transport and glycolysis, such as glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and hexokinase 1, which facilitate glycolytic changes that are capable of metabolically adjusting to fluctuations in normal oxygen tension."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

To determine whether HIF-1 also mediates cell-autonomous responses to hypoxia, we have compared gene expression profiles in arterial endothelial cells cultured under nonhypoxic versus hypoxic conditions and in nonhypoxic cells infected with adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase versus a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha (AdCA5). There were 245 gene probes that showed at least 1.5-fold increase in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5; 325 gene probes showed at least 1.5-fold decrease in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5. The largest category of genes down-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded proteins involved in cell growth/proliferation. Many genes up-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded cytokines/growth factors, receptors, and other signaling proteins. Transcription factors accounted for the largest group of HIF-1-regulated genes, indicating that HIF-1 controls a network of transcriptional responses to hypoxia in endothelial cells. Infection of endothelial cells with AdCA5 under nonhypoxic conditions was sufficient to induce increased basement membrane invasion and tube formation similar to the responses induced by hypoxia, indicating that HIF-1 mediates cell-autonomous activation of endothelial cells."

Therefore, the anticancer effects of these agents might be due, in part, to their inhibition of HIF-1. HIF-1 target genes that are activated in RCC include platelet-derived growth factor-b (PDGFB)and TGF-a. These genes encode proteins that activate the PDGF and EGF receptors  two of the main receptor tyrosine kinases that signal via the PI3K and MAPK pathways to stimulate cell proliferation and survival."

We evaluated the effects of DNA-binding small molecules on hypoxia-inducible transcription of VEGF. A synthetic pyrrole-imidazole polyamide designed to bind the hypoxia response element (HRE) was found to disrupt hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) binding to HRE. In cultured HeLa cells, this resulted in a reduction of VEGF mRNA and secreted protein levels. The observed effects were polyamide-specific and dose-dependent. Analysis of genome-wide effects of the HRE-specific polyamide revealed that a number of hypoxia-inducible genes were down-regulated. Pathway-based regulation of hypoxia-inducible gene expression with DNA-binding small molecules may represent a new approach for targeting angiogenesis."

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49."

Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a potentially devastating disease associated with mutations in two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and 2, that function as a complex to suppress signaling in the mTOR/S6K/4E-BP pathway. However, the inhibitory target of TSC1/2 and the mechanism by which it acts are unknown. Here we provide evidence that TSC1/2 is a GAP for the small GTPase Rheb and that insulin-mediated Rheb activation is PI3K dependent. Moreover, Rheb overexpression induces S6K1 phosphorylation and inhibits PKB phosphorylation, as do loss-of-function mutations in TSC1/2, but contrary to earlier reports Rheb has no effect on MAPK phosphorylation. Finally, coexpression of a human TSC2 cDNA harboring a disease-associated point mutation in the GAP domain, failed to stimulate Rheb GTPase activity or block Rheb activation of S6K1."

Activated class I PI3K mainly uses PtdIns(4,5)P2 as substrate to yield PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane, which increases membrane recruitment of both PKB/Akt and its activator phosphoinositide- dependent protein kinase 1, leading to the activation of PKB/Akt, a downstream negative regulator of autophagy. Activated PKB/Akt further activates mTOR through inhibiting a downstream protein complex, the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2, that represses the small G protein Rheb, causing inhibition of autophagy."

Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a potentially devastating disease associated with mutations in two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and 2, that function as a complex to suppress signaling in the mTOR/S6K/4E-BP pathway. However, the inhibitory target of TSC1/2 and the mechanism by which it acts are unknown. Here we provide evidence that TSC1/2 is a GAP for the small GTPase Rheb and that insulin-mediated Rheb activation is PI3K dependent. Moreover, Rheb overexpression induces S6K1 phosphorylation and inhibits PKB phosphorylation, as do loss-of-function mutations in TSC1/2, but contrary to earlier reports Rheb has no effect on MAPK phosphorylation. Finally, coexpression of a human TSC2 cDNA harboring a disease-associated point mutation in the GAP domain, failed to stimulate Rheb GTPase activity or block Rheb activation of S6K1."

Subsequent recognition that transcriptional regulation of erythropoietin and key angiogenic growth factors are linked to a common control mediated by a transcriptional complex, HIF-1, refocused attention on the possibility that angiogenesis can be regulated specifically by oxygen availability16, 17, 18, 19, and provided a means to address the underlying mechanisms through studies of the regulation of HIF.  HIFs and regulation by protein hydroxylation HIF-1 is an alphabeta-heterodimer that was first recognized as a DNA-binding factor that mediates hypoxia-inducible activity of the erythropoietin 3' enhancer20, 21. Following early studies of the oxygen-dependent activity of the erythropoietin 3' enhancer in a wide variety of non-erythropoietin-producing cells22, it rapidly became clear that the HIF system is a key regulator of many other processes. These include angiogenesis among a broad range of cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia (reviewed in refs. 23,24).  Both the HIF-alpha and HIF-beta subunits exist as a series of isoforms encoded by distinct genetic loci. HIF-1beta subunits are constitutive nuclear proteins, whereas HIF-alpha subunits are inducible by hypoxia. Among three HIF-alpha isoforms, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha appear closely related and are each able to interact with hypoxia response elements (HREs) to induce transcriptional activity25, 26. In contrast, HIF-3alpha appears to be involved in negative regulation of the response, through an alternately spliced transcript termed inhibitory PAS domain protein27. HIF-alpha subunits are regulated by a multistep process involving changes in activity, abundance, mRNA splicing and subcellular localization (reviewed in ref. 24). Recent analysis of post-translational modifications that mediate these processes has revealed an unexpectedly direct interface with the availability of oxygen, through a series of non-heme, iron-dependent oxygenases that hydroxylate specific HIF-alpha residues in an oxygen-dependent manner28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.  Hydroxylation at two prolyl residues (Pro402 and Pro564 in human HIF-1alpha) mediates interactions with the von Hippel?Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIF-alpha for proteasomal destruction28, 29, 30, 34. Each site can interact independently with VHL E3, potentially contributing to the extremely rapid proteolysis of HIF-alpha that is observed in oxygenated cells34. These sites contain a conserved LxxLAP motif and are targeted by a newly defined prolyl hydroxylase activity, that in mammalian cells is provided by three isoforms termed PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain) 1?3 (refs. 31,32). Determining the relative importance of different PHD isoforms in the regulation of HIF-alpha and other potential hydroxylation targets is the subject of active research. In a second hydroxylation-dependent control, beta-hydroxylation of an asparaginyl residue in the C-terminal activation domain of HIF-alpha (Asn803 in human HIF-1alpha)35 is regulated by a HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase33, 36 termed FIH (factor inhibiting HIF)37. Hydroxylation at this site blocks interaction of the HIF-alpha C-terminal activation domain with the transcriptional coactivator p300."

Subsequent recognition that transcriptional regulation of erythropoietin and key angiogenic growth factors are linked to a common control mediated by a transcriptional complex, HIF-1, refocused attention on the possibility that angiogenesis can be regulated specifically by oxygen availability16, 17, 18, 19, and provided a means to address the underlying mechanisms through studies of the regulation of HIF.  HIFs and regulation by protein hydroxylation HIF-1 is an alphabeta-heterodimer that was first recognized as a DNA-binding factor that mediates hypoxia-inducible activity of the erythropoietin 3' enhancer20, 21. Following early studies of the oxygen-dependent activity of the erythropoietin 3' enhancer in a wide variety of non-erythropoietin-producing cells22, it rapidly became clear that the HIF system is a key regulator of many other processes. These include angiogenesis among a broad range of cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia (reviewed in refs. 23,24).  Both the HIF-alpha and HIF-beta subunits exist as a series of isoforms encoded by distinct genetic loci. HIF-1beta subunits are constitutive nuclear proteins, whereas HIF-alpha subunits are inducible by hypoxia. Among three HIF-alpha isoforms, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha appear closely related and are each able to interact with hypoxia response elements (HREs) to induce transcriptional activity25, 26. In contrast, HIF-3alpha appears to be involved in negative regulation of the response, through an alternately spliced transcript termed inhibitory PAS domain protein27. HIF-alpha subunits are regulated by a multistep process involving changes in activity, abundance, mRNA splicing and subcellular localization (reviewed in ref. 24). Recent analysis of post-translational modifications that mediate these processes has revealed an unexpectedly direct interface with the availability of oxygen, through a series of non-heme, iron-dependent oxygenases that hydroxylate specific HIF-alpha residues in an oxygen-dependent manner28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.  Hydroxylation at two prolyl residues (Pro402 and Pro564 in human HIF-1alpha) mediates interactions with the von Hippel?Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIF-alpha for proteasomal destruction28, 29, 30, 34. Each site can interact independently with VHL E3, potentially contributing to the extremely rapid proteolysis of HIF-alpha that is observed in oxygenated cells34. These sites contain a conserved LxxLAP motif and are targeted by a newly defined prolyl hydroxylase activity, that in mammalian cells is provided by three isoforms termed PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain) 1?3 (refs. 31,32). Determining the relative importance of different PHD isoforms in the regulation of HIF-alpha and other potential hydroxylation targets is the subject of active research. In a second hydroxylation-dependent control, beta-hydroxylation of an asparaginyl residue in the C-terminal activation domain of HIF-alpha (Asn803 in human HIF-1alpha)35 is regulated by a HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase33, 36 termed FIH (factor inhibiting HIF)37. Hydroxylation at this site blocks interaction of the HIF-alpha C-terminal activation domain with the transcriptional coactivator p300."

In the presence of oxygen, HIFalpha family members are hydroxylated on one of two conserved prolyl residues by members of the egg-laying-defective nine (EGLN) family. Prolyl hydroxylation generates a binding site for a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which results in HIFalpha destruction. In addition, the HIFalpha transcriptional activation function is modulated further by asparagine hydroxylation by FIH (factor-inhibiting HIF), which affects recruitment of the coactivators p300 and CBP. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into oxygen sensing by metazoans and are the first examples of protein hydroxylation being used in intracellular signaling. The existence of three human EGLN family members, as well as other putative hydroxylases, raises the possibility that this signal is used in other contexts by other proteins. In the presence of oxygen, HIFalpha family members are hydroxylated on one of two conserved prolyl residues by members of the egg-laying-defective nine (EGLN) family.

Phosphorylated R-Smads oligomerize with the common mediator (Co) Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus where they regulate gene expression.\\\""

In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed."

While the amount of CREB in the extracts is unaltered by hormone treatment, more CREB is capable of binding the response element upon addition of dexamethasone (Dex). These studies suggest that synergistic induction of the SDH gene by cAMP and Dex is through a CRE and is due, in part, to regulation of CREB-DNA binding by treatment of the cells with glucocorticoids."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

However, brca2 expression is also deregulated in sporadic breast tumors. In the mouse brca2 gene we had earlier identified a region of 148bp upstream of the transcription start site sufficient to activate its expression. In the present report, we show that the -92 to -40bp region is essential for the transcription of brca2 in murine mammary cells and that this nucleotide sequence contains one putative CREB/ATF consensus site (cAMP responsive element: CRE). We demonstrated that the mutation of this binding site led to a highly significant reduction of the mouse brca2 transcription, and that CREB, CREM, and/or ATF-1 functionally bound to and regulated this promoter. Therefore, the regulation of the promoter of the mouse brca2 gene is driven by this family of transcription factors."

CT105 at nanomolar concentrations strongly activated multiple signaling pathways involving tyrosine kinase-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signal was required for excess TNF-alpha production in human macrophages derived from THP-1 cells. Interferon-gamma significantly potentiated the induction of the CT105-mediated signal cascade. These multiple signaling pathways in turn converged, at least in part, at the nuclear transcription factor known as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which acts on the TNF-alpha gene promoter through the cAMP response element. The cell-permeable cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP partially and almost simultaneously suppressed all of these CT105-induced signaling pathways through excessive CREB phosphorylation, which led to decreased CREB DNA binding activity and reduced TNF-alpha expression. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP decreased the interaction of the p65 nuclear factor-kappa B with CREB binding protein, thus further inhibiting CT105-mediated TNF-alpha expression. Collectively, the detailed molecular mechanisms of amyloidogenic CT-induced TNF-alpha production as negatively regulated by cAMP may advance the possibility of targeted treatment in Alzheimer's disease."

Similarly, a very conserved putative CRE can be identified in the mouse PGC-1-alpha  promoter at approximately the same distance (between 146 and 129) from the transcriptional start site (Fig. 1B). The functional role of this CRE was tested by using a mutated promoter (Fig. 1B), followed by a 10-h stimulation of cells with the cAMP-stimulating agent forskolin. As shown in Fig. 1C, mutagenesis of the CRE site abolished induction of the mouse PGC-1-alpha  promoter by forskolin, as expected. Importantly, expression of the CRE PGC-1-alpha  promoter also showed a dramatically impaired response to CaMKIV alone or the combination of CaMKIV and CnA (Fig. 1C), indicating a key role for CREB in the induction of PGC-1-alpha expression by these mediators of calcium signaling."

Furthermore, mutation of CRE abolishes SREBP-dependent activation after overexpression of SREBP-1a and CRE binding protein (CREB). This shows that CRE is essential, and that under ex vivo conditions CREB and SREBP cooperate in transactivating CYP51. Interestingly, protein kinase A shows a marked stimulation of the CYP51 promoter activity when overexpressed together with SREBP-1a but not when overexpressed with CREB, suggesting phosphorylation of SREBP-1a. Using a DNA probe containing all three regulatory elements, it is found that SREBP-1a, a CREB-like factor, and specificity protein (Sp1) all probably bind the CYP51 promoter. While SREBP-1a and the CRE-bound proteins are essential for the SREBP-dependent response, Sp1 apparently functions only to maximize sterol regulation of CYP51."

Cells expressing exogenous follistatin (Figure 4A) displayed increased number of nuclei and cell size (Figure 4B) and increased fusion index (Figure 4E). To continue investigating whether follistatin has properties similar to those of TSA, skeletal muscle cells were exposed to recombinant follistatin at different stages of differentiation. As for TSA treatment, follistatin did not increase the size of preformed myotubes (Figures 4C, rFS on myotubes, and 4E). In contrast, myoblasts cultured in the presence of follistatin and prompted to differentiate formed hyper-nucleated myotubes with increased size, due to enhanced fusion (Figures 4D, rFS on myoblasts, and 4E). The effects exerted by TSA on myoblasts are unlikely to be mediated by IL-4 (Figure 2). To evaluate whether follistatin could indirectly activate IL-4 expression, we performed an RT-PCR assay on RNA isolated from C2C12 expressing myc-follistatin and found no signs of IL-4 induction (Figure 4F). Therefore, it appears that the effects exerted by follistatin on muscle cells are similar to those exerted by HDAC inhibitors.  MYOD, CREB, AND NFAT MEDIATE THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION OF THE FOLLISTATIN PROMOTER INDUCED BY TSA To investigate the effects of TSA on follistatin transcription, the follistatin promoter linked to luciferase (FS-luc) was transfected in skeletal myoblasts. TSA activated transcription of FS-luc (Figure 5A). Within the follistatin proximal promoter, there are an E box, a CRE element, and a consensus site for NFAT (Figure 5B). To ascertain whether MyoD, CREB, and NFAT could activate FS-luc, we transfected murine fibroblasts with the FS-luc reporter and expression vectors for MyoD, a form of constitutively active CREB (CREB Y134F) (Du et al., 2000) and NFATc2. Either MyoD or CREBY134F activated FS-luc transcription (Figure 5C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) and their cotransfection had an additive effect (Figure 5C, lane 4)."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu..."

The mammalian UPR activates three signal transducers, ATF6, Ire1, and PERK. 1) Activation of ATF6 leads to increased expression of genes regulated by ERSEs in their promoters including ER chaperones like BiP and GRP94, as well as the transcription factor XBP-1. Activation of Ire1 leads to alternative XBP-1 splicing, which in turn up-regulates XBP-1 specific targets like ERdj4, as well as targets with ERSEs in their promoter. A PERK-dependent target other than ATF4 can influence the activation of the ERSE site by an unknown mechanism, which is indicated by a question mark in the schematics. 2) PERK activation leads to eIF-2{alpha} phosphorylation, which allows the expression of the ATF4 transcription factor that in turn induces GADD34 transcription. There is no evidence at this time for members of the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1 pathways to impact on the PERK pathway. 3) Finally, the ATF6, Ire1/XBP-1 and PERK pathways converge to optimally induce targets that include CHOP and Herp. Those targets that are downstream of the PERK branch of the UPR are shared with various other cellular stress conditions like heme deficiency, amino acid deprivation, and dsRNA expression. These stresses all activate an eIF-2{alpha} kinase and as a result induce downstream targets like ATF4 and GADD34, as well as those that are dually regulated by both the shared and the ER stress-specific branches of the UPR, which are represented by CHOP and Herp.

Phosphorylation of eIF2{alpha} inhibits general protein synthesis by reducing the levels of eIF2-GTP that are required for binding of initiator tRNA to the translation apparatus. Concomitant with lowered protein synthesis, eIF2{alpha} phosphorylation leads to preferential translation of ATF4, a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription activator important for directing transcription of stress-related genes (17?20). Reduced protein synthesis conserves energy and provides the cell time for ATF4 and other stress-responsive transcription factors to reconfigure gene expression slated to alleviate damage elicited by the underlying stress. Other members of the eIF2 kinase family include PEK/Perk (EIF2AK3), whose activity is enhanced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (21, 22); HRI (EIF2AK1), which is regulated by heme deficiency and oxidative stress (23); and PKR (EIF2AK2), which functions in an antiviral pathway (24).{P@S52 is the common phosphorylation site between all 4 kinases and confirmed in Uniprot}"

Phosphorylation of eIF2{alpha} inhibits general protein synthesis by reducing the levels of eIF2-GTP that are required for binding of initiator tRNA to the translation apparatus. Concomitant with lowered protein synthesis, eIF2{alpha} phosphorylation leads to preferential translation of ATF4, a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription activator important for directing transcription of stress-related genes (17?20). Reduced protein synthesis conserves energy and provides the cell time for ATF4 and other stress-responsive transcription factors to reconfigure gene expression slated to alleviate damage elicited by the underlying stress. Other members of the eIF2 kinase family include PEK/Perk (EIF2AK3), whose activity is enhanced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (21, 22); HRI (EIF2AK1), which is regulated by heme deficiency and oxidative stress (23); and PKR (EIF2AK2), which functions in an antiviral pathway (24).{P@S52 is the common phosphorylation site between all 4 kinases and confirmed in Uniprot}"

In the presence of oxygen, HIFalpha family members are hydroxylated on one of two conserved prolyl residues by members of the egg-laying-defective nine (EGLN) family. Prolyl hydroxylation generates a binding site for a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which results in HIFalpha destruction. In addition, the HIFalpha transcriptional activation function is modulated further by asparagine hydroxylation by FIH (factor-inhibiting HIF), which affects recruitment of the coactivators p300 and CBP. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into oxygen sensing by metazoans and are the first examples of protein hydroxylation being used in intracellular signaling. The existence of three human EGLN family members, as well as other putative hydroxylases, raises the possibility that this signal is used in other contexts by other proteins.

Phosphorylation of 14-3-3beta by PKC-zeta negatively regulated their physical association. 14-3-3beta with its putative PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites mutated enhanced co-precipitation between PKC-zeta and Raf-1, suggesting that phosphorylation of 14-3-3 by PKC-zeta weakens the complex in vivo. We conclude that 14-3-3 facilitates coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 in an isotype-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner. We suggest that 14-3-3 is a transient mediator of Raf-1 phosphorylation and activation by PKC-zeta."

Fas plays an important role in T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and recently it has been suggested that altered Fas signaling may contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, Fas resistance could be one of the mechanisms by which AML progenitors escape chemotherapy or T-cell-based immune intervention. However, the molecular mechanism of Fas resistance in AML cells has not been identified. Fas signaling can be interrupted at 3 mains levels: Fas clustering, alteration of death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC) formation, and effector caspase inhibition of downstream caspase-8. This study shows that in the Fas-resistant CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1a cells, Fas agonists resulted in Fas aggregation but not in caspase-8 activation, related to a defect in DISC formation. However, pretreatment with chelerythrin, but not with calphostin C, resulted in the restoration of Fas-induced caspase-8 activation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that some atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms contributed to the lack of DISC formation. Indeed, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKC zeta and enforced expression of Par-4, a negative regulator of PKC zeta activity, restored Fas-induced caspase-8 activity and apoptosis. Moreover, it was found that PKC zeta interacts with FADD and that PKC zeta immunoextracts prepared from KG1a cells are able to phosphorylate FADD in vitro, whereas this phosphorylation is dramatically reduced in Par-4 transfectant cells. In conclusion, it is suggested that in AML cells, PKC zeta plays an important role in Fas resistance by inhibiting DISC formation, possibly by phosphorylating FADD."

This ROS response was sensitive to inhibition by diphenyleneiodonium, apocynin, and neopterin, suggestive of an involvement of NADPH oxidases. In line with this, hepatocytes expressed mRNAs not only of the phagocyte gp91phox (Nox 2), but also of the homologs Nox 1 and 4 and Duox 1 and 2, as well as the regulatory subunit p47phox. gp91phox (Nox 2) and p47phox were also identified at the protein level in rat hepatocytes. CD95L induced within 1 min ceramide formation and serine phosphorylation of p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibitors of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). These inhibitors and p47phox protein knockdown inhibited the early CD95L-induced ROS response, suggesting that ceramide and PKCzeta are upstream events of the CD95L-induced Nox/Duox activation. CD95L also induced rapid activation of the Src family kinase Yes"

[36] recently investigated TNF-a-induced HIF-1a accumulation and demonstrated that an NFkB-mediated event that is normally associated with inflammation and cell survival caused protein accumulation in normoxic cells. Although the report fails to identify the mechanism of HIF-1a accumulation, it is suggested that this might interfere with the pVHL-mediated HIF-1a degradation process. Further studies support the concept of a pVHL-dependent cytotoxicity to TNF-a in RCC cells [37,38]. In particular, it has been reported that RCC cells can be sensitized to TNF-a-induced cytotoxicity by re-introducing wild-type VHL [38]. The authors highlight the fact that TNFreceptor engagement by TNF-a triggers the activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which, through IKKb phosphorylation, liberates NFkB, thereby initiating the transcription of genes that are involved in apoptosis."

In the presence of oxygen, HIFalpha family members are hydroxylated on one of two conserved prolyl residues by members of the egg-laying-defective nine (EGLN) family. Prolyl hydroxylation generates a binding site for a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which results in HIFalpha destruction. In addition, the HIFalpha transcriptional activation function is modulated further by asparagine hydroxylation by FIH (factor-inhibiting HIF), which affects recruitment of the coactivators p300 and CBP. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into oxygen sensing by metazoans and are the first examples of protein hydroxylation being used in intracellular signaling. The existence of three human EGLN family members, as well as other putative hydroxylases, raises the possibility that this signal is used in other contexts by other proteins.

There were 245 gene probes that showed at least 1.5-fold increase in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5; 325 gene probes showed at least 1.5-fold decrease in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5. The largest category of genes down-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded proteins involved in cell growth/proliferation. Many genes up-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded cytokines/growth factors, receptors, and other signaling proteins. Transcription factors accounted for the largest group of HIF-1-regulated genes, indicating that HIF-1 controls a network of transcriptional responses to hypoxia in endothelial cells. Infection of endothelial cells with AdCA5 under nonhypoxic conditions was sufficient to induce increased basement membrane invasion and tube formation similar to the responses induced by hypoxia, indicating that HIF-1 mediates cell-autonomous activation of endothelial cells."

The two most C-terminal serine residues become phosphorylated and, together with a third, non-phosphorylated serine residue, form an evolutionarily conserved SSXS motif in all R-Smads.... TGF-b and activin receptors phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3, and BMP receptors phosphorylate Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 (Chen et al., 1998) (Fig. 1). The consequence of R-Smad phosphorylation is the formation of oligomeric complexes with the Co-Smad, Smad4."

TGF-B is able to increase the production of mitogenic growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor,51 fibroblast growth factor,52 TGF-B,53 and connective tissue growth factor,54 and to increase expression of the platelet derived growth factor receptor,55 and the epithelial growth factor receptor.56 In addition, TGF-B can activate Smad independent pathways, including the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway,20-22,57,58 which often mediates the proliferative signal of growth factors. Indeed, it is in conjunction with oncogenic forms of Ras (Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras), that TGF-B drives Smad-independent proliferation of human colon and prostate cancer cells.3,49"

TGF-B is secreted into the extracellular matrix as a latent protein complex bound to a latency- associated protein and one of the four isoforms of latent TGF-B binding protein. Activation of TGF-B, which is required for biologic activity, occurs through poorly understood mechanisms likely involving proteolytic processing of the associated proteins and release of the TGF-B ligand. Once activated, the TGF-B ligands regulate cellular processes by binding to three high-affinity cell surface receptors: the type I TGF-B receptor (TBRI), type II TGF-B receptor (TBRII), and type III TGF-B receptor (TBRIII, also referred to as betaglycan). Where expressed, TBRIII is the most abundant TGF-B receptor and classically functions by binding the TGF-B ligand and transferring it to its signaling receptors, TBRI and TBRII.12 TBRI and TBRII contain serine/threonine protein kinases in their intracellular domains. TBRI initiates intracellular signaling by phosphorylating a family of transcription factors, the Smads. Smad2 and Smad3 are the receptor-activated Smads for TGF-B because they are phosphorylated by TBRI. Smad4 is a common partner for all of the receptor-activated Smads. Smad6 and Smad7 are inhibitory Smads that block the phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3, thus inhibiting TGF-B signaling. A general mechanism for TGF-B signaling has been elucidated (Fig 1).13,14 The TGF-B ligand either binds to TBRIII, which presents TGF-B to TBRII, or binds to TBRII directly. Once bound to TGF-B, TBRII recruits, binds, and transphosphorylates TBRI, thereby stimulating its protein kinase activity. The activated TBRI phosphorylates Smad2 or Smad3, which binds to Smad4. The resulting Smad complex translocates into the nucleus and interacts in a cell specific manner with transcription factors to regulate  specifically the transcription of a multitude of TGF-B responsive genes"

This protein can also interact with and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38alpha), and thus represents an alternative activation pathway, in addition to the MAPKK pathways, which contributes to the biological responses of MAPK14 to various stimuli.

In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed."

Binding of TGF-? to its type II receptor in concert with the type I receptor (A) leads to formation of a receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 or 3 (B), allowing this complex to associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus (C). In the nucleus, the Smad complex associates with a transcription factor and this complex binds to specific enhancers in target genes (down-) regulating transcription (D). TNF is able to interfere with TGF-? signaling through the upregulation of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (E). Smad7 is capable of inhibiting the Smad2 and 3 phosphorylating process by competing with the receptor interaction but Smad7 also can dephosphorylate the complex. In addition, Smad7 itself is capable to upregulate TGF? gene expression. As described in the discussion, CSE is most likely capable to interfere with the Smad pathway although this is not yet fully elucidated. (F). Phosphorylated Smad3 is able to stimulate the transcription of the decorin gene (G)."

Adenoviruses expressing constitutively activated TGF-beta type I receptor led to robust actin reorganization and Rho activation, whereas the constitutively activated TGF-beta type I receptor with mutated Smad docking sites (L45 loop) did not affect either actin organization or Rho activity. In line with this, ectopic expression of the inhibitory Smad7 inhibited TGF-beta1-induced Rho activation and cytoskeletal reorganization. Our data define a novel pathway emanating from the TGF-beta type I receptor and leading to regulation of actin assembly, via the kinase LIMK2."

TGF-B is secreted into the extracellular matrix as a latent protein complex bound to a latency- associated protein and one of the four isoforms of latent TGF-B binding protein. Activation of TGF-B, which is required for biologic activity, occurs through poorly understood mechanisms likely involving proteolytic processing of the associated proteins and release of the TGF-B ligand. Once activated, the TGF-B ligands regulate cellular processes by binding to three high-affinity cell surface receptors: the type I TGF-B receptor (TBRI), type II TGF-B receptor (TBRII), and type III TGF-B receptor (TBRIII, also referred to as betaglycan). Where expressed, TBRIII is the most abundant TGF-B receptor and classically functions by binding the TGF-B ligand and transferring it to its signaling receptors, TBRI and TBRII.12 TBRI and TBRII contain serine/threonine protein kinases in their intracellular domains. TBRI initiates intracellular signaling by phosphorylating a family of transcription factors, the Smads. Smad2 and Smad3 are the receptor-activated Smads for TGF-B because they are phosphorylated by TBRI. Smad4 is a common partner for all of the receptor-activated Smads. Smad6 and Smad7 are inhibitory Smads that block the phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3, thus inhibiting TGF-B signaling. A general mechanism for TGF-B signaling has been elucidated (Fig 1).13,14 The TGF-B ligand either binds to TBRIII, which presents TGF-B to TBRII, or binds to TBRII directly. Once bound to TGF-B, TBRII recruits, binds, and transphosphorylates TBRI, thereby stimulating its protein kinase activity. The activated TBRI phosphorylates Smad2 or Smad3, which binds to Smad4. The resulting Smad complex translocates into the nucleus and interacts in a cell specific manner with transcription factors to regulate  specifically the transcription of a multitude of TGF-B responsive genes"

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY29004 reverses the ability of IGF-I to inhibit TGF-beta-induced transcriptional responses and the activation of Smad3, suggesting that the suppression of TGF-beta signaling by IGF-I is mediated through activation of PI3K. Moreover, we show that enforced expression of dominant-negative PI3K (DN-p85alpha) or phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-phosphatase, PTEN, also reverse the suppressive effect of IGF-I on TGF-beta-induced 3TP-luciferase reporter activity, whereas constitutively active PI3K (p110alphaCAAX) completely blocks TGF-beta-induced 3TP-luciferase reporter activity."

The two most C-terminal serine residues become phosphorylated and, together with a third, non-phosphorylated serine residue, form an evolutionarily conserved SSXS motif in all R-Smads.... TGF-b and activin receptors phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3, and BMP receptors phosphorylate Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 (Chen et al., 1998) (Fig. 1). The consequence of R-Smad phosphorylation is the formation of oligomeric complexes with the Co-Smad, Smad4."

Here we show that the TGF-beta intracellular effector Smad3, but not Smad2, mediates the inhibition of myogenic differentiation in MyoD-expressing C3H10T1/2 cells and C2C12 myoblasts by repressing the activity of the MyoD family of transcriptional factors. Central to the induction of myogenic differentiation is the function of the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, which include MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4 and are collectively referred to as myogenic regulatory factors or MRFs"

In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed."

Binding of TGF-? to its type II receptor in concert with the type I receptor (A) leads to formation of a receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 or 3 (B), allowing this complex to associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus (C). In the nucleus, the Smad complex associates with a transcription factor and this complex binds to specific enhancers in target genes (down-) regulating transcription (D). TNF is able to interfere with TGF-? signaling through the upregulation of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (E). Smad7 is capable of inhibiting the Smad2 and 3 phosphorylating process by competing with the receptor interaction but Smad7 also can dephosphorylate the complex. In addition, Smad7 itself is capable to upregulate TGF? gene expression. As described in the discussion, CSE is most likely capable to interfere with the Smad pathway although this is not yet fully elucidated. (F). Phosphorylated Smad3 is able to stimulate the transcription of the decorin gene (G)."

LPS stimulation induces NADPH oxidase activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PMNs as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00baB signaling in endothelial cells and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00baB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration. Thus, the PMN NADPH oxidase\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mediated TLR4-TLR2 cross talk activates a positive feedback signal leading to sustained and amplified endothelial activation in response to invading pathogens."

The Rel homology domain consists of three regions, including a nuclear localization sequence, a DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization region [405]. Functional NF- kB is composed of dimers formed from p50, p52, Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel proteins [412-414]. In unstimulated cells, the nuclear localization sequence of NF-kB is bound to inhibitory proteins (IkB), thus maintaining it in the cytosol [415]. IkB proteins include IkBa [416] IkBb [417], IkBg [418,419], and possibly Bcl-3 [420,421]. Interestingly, the proteins previously believed to be precursor proteins of p50 and p52 known as p105 [422,423] and p100 [424] also exhibit IkB activity [424-426]. Recently, it was found that both p105 and p50 are generated from the same transcript but that the p105 protein is not actually a precursor of p50 [427]. The best studied of the IkB proteins is IkBa. Stimulation of cells leads to hyperphosphorylation of IkBaserines 32 and 36 [428-431] via activation of Nik, which phosphorylates IkB kinase (Fig. 2) [432-434]. Phosphorylation alone has no effect on the binding of the inhibitor to NF-kB [430,435,436]; however, it does provide a signal for ubiquitination at lysines 21 and 22 [437-439], which stimulates degradation of IkBaby the 26S proteasome complex. Dissociation of IkB and NF-kB proteins permits migration of the active NF-kB dimer to the nucleus [440], where it can bind to DNA and initiate transcription. ROS activate NF-kB by causing the release of the inhibitory subunit (IkB) from the NF-kB complex [11]."

We also showed that Syk induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, which caused the dissociation, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of p65. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate that H2O2 induces NF-kappaB activation, not through serine phosphorylation or degradation of IkappaBalpha, but through Syk-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha"

As shown in Fig. 3C, the hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of ACC observed in WT A549 cells was prevented in {rho}0-A549 cells. To confirm that the lack of activation of AMPK in {rho}0-A549 cells was caused by the absence of mitochondrial ROS and that these cells respond to ROS, the cells were treated with exogenous t-H2O2."
